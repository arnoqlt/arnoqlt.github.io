Hi!

I am Arnaud, a French PhD student in the field of deep learning applied to medical imaging.

I am currently working on digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), an X-ray imaging modality dedicated to breast cancer screening.

Use this website to see my latest publications. You can also check out some GitHub repositories that I find interesting.
